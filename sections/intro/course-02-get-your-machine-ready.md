# Get Your Machine Ready

Every playground and lab in this course runs on your own machine, in a small Kubernetes cluster. A tool called `astrona` builds it for you, sets it up, grades your work and removes it again. This page gets your machine ready: first the tools you need, then the handful of `astrona` commands you will use every day, and last what to do when a start goes wrong.

## What you need

Every section needs the same set of tools. Install these before you start:

- **A container engine:** Docker or Podman. The cluster runs inside it.
- **`kind`:** runs Kubernetes inside the container engine.
- **`kubectl`:** talks to the cluster.
- **The astrona command-line tool.**
- **`jq`:** reads the JSON that `kubectl` and `istioctl` print, so you can pick out one field.

You do not need to install `istioctl` or `helm` yourself. Each playground and lab installs the exact version it needs, `istioctl` 1.30.5 (and 1.29.8 in the upgrade section) and Helm 3, so the client always matches the task. If a page says `istioctl: command not found`, the binary went to your home directory; run `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` and try again.

The playgrounds and labs need **outbound internet** while they start. They download Istio from `istio.io`, Helm and (in the ambient section) the Gateway API CRDs from GitHub, and the Istio Helm charts from the Istio chart repository. Without outbound internet, those starts fail with network errors that have nothing to do with Istio.

You do not have to check all of this by hand. Let `astrona` look at your machine for you:

```sh
astrona setup
```

`astrona setup` looks at what is missing, shows you each step it would take, and asks before it does anything. On macOS it can install `kind`, `kubectl` and Podman. Install `jq` yourself.

Later, you can check your machine at any time:

```sh
astrona check
```

## The commands you use every day

Once your machine is ready, you need only a handful of `astrona` commands. Each module page and lab page shows the exact command to copy, so you do not need to remember paths. This section walks through them in the order you meet them: sign in, start, pause, submit and clean up.

Labs from the course catalog are tied to your Astrona account, so you sign in first:

```sh
astrona login
```

Next you start a playground or a lab. Each module page and lab page shows the exact `astrona run` command for it. It looks like this:

```sh
astrona run --git ssh://git@github.com/astrona-io/ATS013.git -c sections/section-010/module-01/playground
```

When the cluster is ready, `kubectl` already points at it.

A chapter that sends you to a lab asks you to pause the playground first. Pausing frees your machine's memory but keeps everything you built:

```sh
astrona stop <name>
```

When the lab is done, start the playground again and carry on where you left off:

```sh
astrona start <name>
```

Inside a lab, you send your work for grading with `astrona submit`. The grader checks the live cluster: which Deployments and Helm releases exist and at which version, the mesh settings, which control plane each proxy is connected to, and real requests where it matters. So your change has to actually be in place, not only look right in a file. Each lab page shows the exact command:

```sh
astrona submit -c sections/section-010/module-01/labs/lab-01
```

You can submit as often as you like.

When you are done with a playground or a lab, remove it:

```sh
astrona destroy <name>
```

The name is the environment's name, printed by `astrona run` and shown on each page (for example `ats-013-playground-010-01`). It is not the folder path. To see what is on your machine, list it:

```sh
astrona list
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Run one environment at a time.** Each playground and lab is a whole cluster. Two running at once slow your machine down, and it is easy to send a command to the wrong one. Pause or destroy the playground before you start the lab.

## When a start goes wrong

Sometimes a playground or lab does not start cleanly. Ask `astrona` what is wrong before you try anything else:

```sh
astrona doctor
```

It checks your machine, the lab's configuration and the running lab, and tells you how to fix what it finds.

If a start fails while it downloads something, check your network first. Remember also that the starting state differs per module on purpose: some clusters have no Istio, and some have an older version. The module's landing page tells you what to expect. With your machine ready and these commands at hand, you can start the first module.
